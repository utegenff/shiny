# Shiny app for midterm project
An application to explore the Number of suicide deaths in a year per 100,000 population. Measuring how many people die each year and why they died is one of the most important means – along with gauging how diseases and injuries are affecting people  – for assessing the effectiveness of a country’s health system. Cause-of-death statistics help health authorities determine their focus for public health actions.
